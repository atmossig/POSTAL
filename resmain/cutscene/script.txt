* 01/21/00 - MJR - I created this script for generating multialphas for the two
*                  new cutscenes.  I derived the values by trying them out for
*                  an existing scene until I generated a file that matched the
*                  existing file.  The same values could be used to recreate
*                  any other cutscene multialphas (I'm guessing they all use
*                  the same values).

	palette = "tokyo-1.bmp";
	output = "tokyo-1.mlp";
	levels = 3;
	values = .5;
	FinalColors = 10,236;
	}
